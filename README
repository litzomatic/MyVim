Will put my vim settings etc. here.

1. Install Pathogen

http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332
Direction at site.

2. Install HILINKS

http://drchip.0sites.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#HILINKS
to install :help vimball
:HLT
:verbose hi cursorline
Help figure out your highlighting quickly.

3. Use vim as diff tool for git.

git config --global diff.tool vimdiff
git difftool

4. iPython Highlighting and Integration

Pygment style is zenburn.py

On my mac the path to the directory to place zenburn.py is:
/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pygments/styles.

I hacked the following line so my pygments would load.  In upstream versions of iPython this is not necessary.

grep -n -r zenburn .
./site-packages/IPython/frontend/qt/console/styles.py:44:default_dark_syntax_style = 'zenburn'
Use grep -n -r linux . to find the line for yourself.

Starting ipython

ipython-2.7 qtconsole --editor=vim --colors=linux --stylesheet=zenburn_ipython.css

5. iPython vim code completion and perhaps other niceties.

ipy.vim contains the logic, mostly some fixes for the tab completion, which is the most important
feature at the moment. Others will be brought in as time permits.
start_ipython_vim.sh starts and connects vim to iPython in a single command.
Note: This will need to be updated for iPython .12

6. Install SuperTab http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643

DO Section

Make vimdiff highlighting better.
Change traceback highlighting in iPython.
Add mapping tab to ctrl-x ctrl-u
Find Python CTag Like Highlighting or get CTag highlighting working again
improve ipy.vim pull in changes from most recent
More vim plugins...
Upgrade to dev version of iPython. (maybe)
It would be nice if cursorline was the highest priority. In this way the line your editing
won't constantly have ErrorMsg highlighting as your typing.
Autofold Python Code
