Will put my vim settings etc. here.

1. Install Pathogen

http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332
Direction at site.

2. Install HILINKS

http://drchip.0sites.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#HILINKS
to install :help vimball
:HLT
:verbose hi cursorline
Help figure out your highlighting quickly.

3. Use vim as diff tool for git.

git config --global diff.tool vimdiff
git difftool

4. iPython Highlighting and Integration

Pygment style is zenburn.py

On my mac the path to the directory to place zenburn.py is:
/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pygments/styles.

I hacked the following line so my pygments would load.  In upstream versions of iPython this is not necessary.

grep -n -r zenburn .
./site-packages/IPython/frontend/qt/console/styles.py:44:default_dark_syntax_style = 'zenburn'
Use grep -n -r linux . to find the line for yourself.

Starting ipython

ipython-2.7 qtconsole --editor=vim --colors=linux --stylesheet=zenburn_ipython.css

5. iPython vim code completion and perhaps other niceties.

ipy.vim contains the logic, mostly some fixes for the tab completion, which is the most important
feature at the moment. Others will be brought in as time permits.
start_ipython_vim.sh starts and connects vim to iPython in a single command.
Note: This will need to be updated for iPython .12

6. Install SuperTab http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643

It would be nice if cursorline was the highest priority. In this way the line your editing

Zen Coding
Sass or Less? https://gist.github.com/674726
Sass + Compass + 960 + adapt.js + 960 gridder?
CoffeeScript
The CoffeeScript compiler is itself written in CoffeeScript, using the Jison parser generator. The command-line version of coffee is available as a Node.js utility. The core compiler however, does not depend on Node, and can be run in any JavaScript environment, or in the browser (see "Try CoffeeScript", above).

To install, first make sure you have a working copy of the latest stable version of Node.js, and npm (the Node Package Manager). You can then install CoffeeScript with npm:
